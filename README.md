- `-e`: The expression to evaluate (e.g. "3(x^3)+4(x)+5")
- `-m`: The mode ("derivative" or "integral"), with "derivative" as default
- `x`: The point/value at which to evaluate the derivative (default: 1)
- `u`: The upper bound of the integral (default: 20)
- `l`: The lower bound of the integral (default: 0)
